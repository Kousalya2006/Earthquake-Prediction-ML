 Earthquake Prediction using Machine Learning
A Machine Learning Project by Kousalya Vallamkonda (CSE – AIML)

This project predicts the magnitude or risk of earthquakes using machine learning models trained on historical seismic datasets.
It analyses key earthquake features such as latitude, longitude, depth, and seismic readings to forecast possible earthquake intensity.

The project includes a GUI application, model training code, and saved ML model for instant predictions.

 Project Overview

Earthquakes are unpredictable natural disasters. This project attempts to use machine learning regression/classification techniques to estimate earthquake risk/magnitude.

This project demonstrates:

🔹 Data preprocessing

🔹 Feature engineering

🔹 ML model training

🔹 Saving & loading ML models

🔹 GUI-based prediction system

🔹 Result visualization

 Features

✔ Predict earthquake magnitude or risk score
✔ GUI (Graphical User Interface) for user-friendly predictions
✔ Pretrained ML model (eq_model_bundle_new.pkl)
✔ Automated training pipeline using train_model_new.py
✔ Visualized results stored in results_new/
✔ Dataset included for retraining

 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Tkinter (or CustomTkinter for GUI)

Matplotlib / Seaborn

 How to Run the Project
1️ Install Dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


(Tkinter comes preinstalled with Python)

2️ Train the Model (Optional)

Run the training script:

python train_model_new.py


This will:

Load dataset.csv

Preprocess the data

Train ML model

Save it as eq_model_bundle_new.pkl

3️  Run the GUI Prediction App
python app_gui_new.py


You will see a prediction window where you can enter:

Latitude

Longitude

Depth

Seismic values

Other input features

Then click "Predict" to get the earthquake magnitude/risk.

 Results

All generated graphs and output metrics are stored inside:

results_new/


These may include:

Feature importance

Error comparison graphs

Prediction visualizations

 Machine Learning Model

The model used in this project can be:

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression (classification version)

The final model is saved as eq_model_bundle_new.pkl for quick loading.

 Dataset

dataset.csv contains:

Latitude & Longitude

Depth

Magnitude

Geological parameters

Seismic readings

Dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before training.

 Future Improvements

🔹 Deploy as a web application (Flask / Streamlit)
🔹 Add real-time earthquake data APIs
🔹 Use LSTM/RNN for time-series forecasting
🔹 Add heatmap visualization of earthquake zones
